Bikeshare usage in three cities: Chicago, New York and Washington  
Udacity - Programming for Data Science - Python project

### Description
Compute descriptive statistics for 6 month bike sharing data of three cities.<br/>

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. Renters can borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B. Usage data of the bicyles has been provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider. Data from 3 cities, Chicago, New York and Washington for a 6 month period has been provided.<br/>

The python program computes various descriptive statistics on:  
1)Popular times for renting  
2)Popular stations and trip  
3)Trip Duration  
4)User information (certain information available only for NYC and Chicago)<br/>

The program is interactive in providing the user option to select a city, add filters for month and day of the week and finally, option to see the raw data.<br/>

This project was done in the Udacity - Programming for Data Science Nanodegree program - Python Module
